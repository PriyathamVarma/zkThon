# Challenge 1 : Create a simple todo dapp in zkEVM

> **Challenge Description:** In this challenge, you will create a simple todo application that runs on the Polygon network. The application should allow users to create and manage todo items, and the data should be stored on the Polygon network.

<h2>Challenge Tasks:</h2>

<ul>
  
<li> Set up your development environment to work with zkEVM Polygon. </li>
<li> Write a smart contract that can store todo items on the Polygon zkEVM network. </li>
<li> Create a frontend interface that allows users to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) todo items. </li>
<li> Connect the frontend to the smart contract so that the data is stored on the Polygon network. </li>
<li> Test the application by creating, updating, and deleting todo items. </li>
  
</ul>


<h2> Submission Guidelines </h2>

Step 1: Create a fork of the repo

Step 2: Create a new branch with your name, level and challenge like <YOURNAME_CHALLENGE_1>

Step 3: In the respective challenge directory create a folder named after you. (Example: When contributing to zkThon/challenge-1 solution, create a folder named as <YOUR_NAME>.)

Step 4: Now , create two folders named as smart_contracts and Frontend

Step 5: In the smart_contracts folder create a file named as todo.sol and paste your code

Step 6: In the frontend folder, create a small dapp that contains the logic to interact with the smart contract

Step 7: Create a pull request to the main branch of the repository with the changes.

Step 8: Make sure to include a detailed description of your solution and any challenges you faced. Also, try to give the tech stack and programming language used.
